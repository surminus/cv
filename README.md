## About Me

I'm an experienced (>10 years) Operations Engineer with a focus on automation
and tooling. Most of my career has been spent working with Linux systems, and I
cut my teeth working in customer facing support.

I enjoy writing tools in Ruby, Go and occasionally Bash. I've worked with
Continuous Integration and Deployment systems, and have a strong interest in
automating away problems with code.

Much of my work in the last few years has been within an AWS environment, and I
feel comfortable working within the huge Amazon ecosystem and working with the
AWS SDK.

I've worked with Terraform for several years, and more recently spent time
working with containers, specifically with Amazon ECS.

In the future, I'd love to work on platforms with either Kubernetes or
serverless technologies. I'm interested in expanding my horizons in terms of
platform scale, and continuing to improve my software development skillset.

## Site Reliability Engineer (March 2018 - Present)

Where: [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com)

As the sole SRE at FutureLearn, my role is to engage with Software Engineers to
improve the development workflow, CI and deployment methods and improve the
core infrastructure of the site and processes around it.

Since I was the only SRE, I focused my role on rapidly improving infrastructure
ready for scale, and working with everyone around me to bring them along for
the ride, to ensure Software Engineers, Technical Leads and Technical
Architects were able to support and improve the platform without me.

As part of this, I gave regular technical lightning talks and interactive
workshops.

Some projects I worked on include:

* CI project to speed up the overall build time for the main application,
  reducing test times from ~15m to ~5m. Built and configured a CI system to
  replace the out-of-date CI system currently in use and organised migration
  over.
* Unified all infrastructure code into Terraform, replacing manual provisioning
  tasks with automated instance bootstrapping.
* Wrote a command-line tool in Go for developers to ease deployments and
  work with SSH, AWS, CI, Datadog, Docker and more
* Lead the operating system upgrade for servers (from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu
  18.04).
* Lead the fundamental work to modernise the platform with a migration from EC2
  based deployments to Amazon ECS, with a focus on scalability and simplicity
* Scaled the platform to handle a huge spike in traffic during COVID19, going
  from ~200 req/s to ~600 req/s

## Senior Web Operations Engineer (January 2017 - March 2018)

Where: [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/)

As Technical Lead for GOV.UK Infrastructure, I lead a team of Web Ops Engineers
and Software Engineer, and worked alongside the Delivery and Product Managers in
moving GOV.UK toward a modern infrastructure, by helping to plan and organise
work within the team.

In my technical role, I balanced enabling Software Engineers to deploy code as
quickly and safely as possible on the current platform, with maintaining and
improving the infrastructure, and increasing automation and self-healing so
that everyone could concentrate on improvements rather than maintenance.

GOV.UK is critical national infrastructure, and it was vital our users, the UK
taxpayer, were able to reliably access content published on the site.

I worked with other Technical Leads, Delivery Managers and Product Managers to
ensure we were working toward the right goals, and provided guidance and advice
based upon my experience. I also worked with Technical Architects to provide
the vision for the future of the platform, which included highly available,
ephemeral and dynamic infrastructure and a transition from DIY to cloud native
services.

## Web Operations Engineer (May 2014 - January 2017)

Where: [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/)

* Worked in a multi-disciplinary team, responding to both technical and business needs
* Maintained and supported the ongoing needs of the evolving infrastructure
* Heavily involved in contributing and improving Puppet code
* Part of out-of-hours and in-office 2nd Line support
* I engaged with and learnt the platform that runs GOV.UK, and planned and
  contributed to a number of improvements to functions such as monitoring,
  logging, CI, deployment, backups and DR.  GOV.UK is made up of over 50
  microservices, mostly using Ruby on Rails, and the platform includes MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Jenkins (Deployment and CI), Varnish,
  NGINX, Redis and a number of other technologies

## Linux Systems Administrator (June 2008 - May 2014)

Where: [Pulsant](https://www.pulsant.com/), formerly [DediPower Managed Hosting](https://www.theregister.com/2011/10/04/lumison_acquires_dedipower/)

* Supported all customers as part of the 2nd, and then 3rd Line support team
  providing extensive on-call coverage and support, often responding to and
  fixing issues from customers weâ€™d had very little experience with previously,
  along with being a point of contact for larger and more complex systems
* Provided technical guidance and ensured efficient knowledge sharing with new
  hires during a period of high growth (from a dozen to over 60 people)
* Primarily Linux based, we also had to provide support to a wide range of
  systems including Windows, VMWare, Cisco firewalls and server hardware
* Worked with customers, other members of the support team, and other parts of
  the business including networking, sales, datacentre and provisioning teams
* As a junior, did long-term work experience in building one of our
  datacentres, which included the initial power cabling, air conditioning
  implentation, networking, and full rack placement. Probably still the best
  experience of my career!
